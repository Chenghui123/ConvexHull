# Computing the Convex Hull in 2D...
Here are some algorthms to compute the Convex Hull for a set of points in 2D using Python.

The algorithms I use are:

1. Graham Scan.
  - Also plotting each step of the algorithm.

2. Jarvis March (Gift Wrapping):
  - Also plotting each step of the algorithm. (Needs some modifications...)
